# AILO - Premium Matchmaking Powered by Science

## What is AILO?
AILO is a premium matchmaking service based in South Florida that uses a patented compatibility methodology (US Patent #8556630B2) built on 30 years of behavioral science research. Unlike dating apps that rely on proximity and photos, AILO matches people based on deep compatibility — only introducing members who are 70%+ compatible.

## How AILO Works
1. Members complete a 7-minute scientific assessment
2. The assessment measures 6 compatibility markers: Magnetism, Connection, Comfort, Perception, Objectives, and Timing
3. Members are matched only with people who score 70%+ compatibility
4. Every member is personally vetted through a strategy call
